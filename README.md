# Pang

## Introduction
This is a submission for the Pang Game Unity Exercise.

## Extra Credits
* **Architecture designed with MVC paradigm:** The project's codebase is built upon the MVC architectural pattern, providing a foundation for maintainability and scalability. Specifically, it employs AMVCC, a Unity-compatible choice that enhances flexibility with components while reducing the need for extensive references through the application script.
* **Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty:** The project includes seven different levels with increasing difficulty. The different levels are important to make the game feel less like a prototype and more like a full game.
* **Custom visuals and shaders:** The project does not include custom shaders but features multiple custom visuals, including custom fonts, animations, background elements, custom UI, VFX, and camera shake.
* **Custom soundtracks and SFX:** The game includes three distinct music themes and a variety of sound effects. The SFX incorporate random pitch variations for increased diversity, and the project includes an audio mixer for greater audio control.
